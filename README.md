# Trump's Twitter Vomit 

Trump's Twitter Vomit is a mobile application written with Ionic 2 and Cordova PhoneGap that will update you once daily if Trump has tweeted any HUGE deals or FAKE NEWS lately.

## Motivation

Every morning I've built up an interesting habit of checking Donald J Trump's Twitter profile to see if he's said anything funny while I was sleeping. Generally I find he will tweet in the AM around 06:30 while watching the news, this inspires the more colourful side of Mr. Trump. I enjoy reading the random accusations and "scandals" as they happen, I build this with a smile on my face because I'm a Canadian but deep down I'm making light of a poor situation. Nonetheless, I need an app that will notify me once or twice daily to let me know (preferably once in the morning when I wake up and once at night) IF and only IF Trump has tweeted containing something WORTHY.
